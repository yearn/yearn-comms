Today we invite you to celebrate the first year of Yearn with [The Blue Pill](https://medium.com/iearn/the-blue-pill-ca44ed01f16f), a spiritual guide for the past, present and future of Yearn. A beautifully-typeset book is available to our 13,500 most loyal supporters.

Your contribution is immortalized in a [set of seven unique NFTs](https://galaxy.eco/yearn) by
[@Zemm_NFT](https://twitter.com/Zemm_NFT). Whether you are a farmer, a governor, a doer, or a giver, Yearn wouldn't have been the same without you. You are all necessary.

This is an invitation to contribute. We attempt to answer what makes Yearn unique by diving deep into the magic of The Gift which has sparked the project. Keep the book close, or share it with a friend. Keep our story alive, you are already part of it.
