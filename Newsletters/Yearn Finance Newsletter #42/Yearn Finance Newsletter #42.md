## **Migrate Or Die**

The v1 vaults have served everyone as a reliable source of yield for almost a year, but now the time has come to say goodbye. All old vaults have been harvested one last time and strategies have been unwinded. As a reminder, our v2 vaults entail several changes such as deploying capital across several strategies for more efficiency and better risk-adjusted yield.

You can migrate to v2 at any time without fees.

Check out the vaults here at [yearn.finance/vaults](https://yearn.finance/vaults).

## **New Curve Gauge Voting Strategy**

Thanks to the great work of the Strategists at Yearn, we have discovered the most optimal Curve Finance gauge voting strategy to generate our users the most yield. This newer strategy has enabled us to get up to 20% higher yields on our current positions utilizing veCRV.

As always, we are striving to bring you all the best risk-adjusted yields in DeFi, with Strategists constantly pushing code to make the Yearn experience better. Deposit capital into the yVaults and let our Strategists do the hard work.

## **What It Takes To Be A Strategist**

![](image6.png)

Over $5M has been paid to Yearn strategists in 2021. At EthCC, Facu Ameal broke down what it takes to become a mighty strategist like him. Strategies, as you may know, are the backbone to Yearn and allow you to earn the best risk-adjusted yield on your tokens.

To summarize, Facu goes over the information about vaults and strategies, the interactions between them, and finally, the tools and procedures used to write and release strategies to the general public.
