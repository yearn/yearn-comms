## Introducing V3 of Yearn’s UI

![](image2.png)

This week, we have opened up the new Yearn v3 to users in beta. The new friendlier interface surfaces all the data you need for a birds-eye view of your holdings and historical plus yearly earnings. It also simulates transactions so you don't get unexpected slippage or failed transactions.

Rebuilt from the ground up, v3 is the realization of a shared vision of a lightweight, scalable system ready for the multichain future. The core components of the Yearn V3 stack have been divided up into multiple distinct components: Lens, Meta, Subgraph, Exporter, SDK, and Front-end. 

As for the UI, we have revamped the Yearn experience for mobile users and added new sections such as the Home, Wallet, Labs, Iron Bank, and Settings pages. Additionally, there will be multiple UI themes, with some being unlockable for specific NFT holders. See [galaxy.eco/yearn](https://galaxy.eco/yearn) for potential NFTs that qualify for future themes.

Thank you to the Yearn community and all the contributors at Yearn who helped to make this happen. If you’d like to contribute, come join our public [discord](https://discord.gg/8rF374XkXy), create an issue in one of the [repos](https://github.com/yearn) linked in the [medium](https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-ui-v3-0-a194355bdb1f), or share your designs with us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance)!

Read an in-depth rundown on the V3 UI [here](https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-ui-v3-0-a194355bdb1f).

## Check Out the New Labs Section

![](image3.png)

Introducing the Labs section on the new Yearn V3 UI, a set of experimental vaults that push the boundaries of yield in DeFi. Let’s take a look at these new vaults.

The vaults that live in the LABS section are not the usual Yearn vaults. Yearn vaults were created with the idea of being long only and that users could withdraw at any time. You asked for different types of vaults and strategies on various platforms and our recent product survey. We listened!

In labs, experimentation is the norm, not the exception. Read what each vault does, and read carefully. Strategies may allow lock-ups and the potential for temporary losses in pursuit of increased, long-term sustainable yield.

You may already know yveCRV, yvBOOST, and our yvBOOST-ETH pJar (a collab with Pickle Finance), which are now live in Labs. We will shortly be adding more vaults to Labs, with detailed pages for each.

So, check out Labs at [beta.yearn.finance/#labs](https://beta.yearn.finance/#/labs) and come back for more emerging strategies. Just remember, these vaults are usually riskier than others, as they can involve token locking, impermanent loss, and various other risks.

## Yearn Has Purchased $320K of YFI in September

![](image4.png)

In accordance with YIP-56: Buyback and Build Yearn, which was passed in January 2021, the Yearn Treasury has purchased an additional $320K worth of YFI.

Yearn Treasury will periodically purchase additional YFI in the future using profits earned by the protocol until a new governance proposal is passed that alters this buyback policy. You can read about the BABY proposal [here](https://snapshot.org/#/yearn/proposal/Qmb6gBzjvgLMazSrQQGVcjutLNdkVyM2Lh6yckMzdoaHWZ). 

Data on the buybacks can be found [here](https://www.yfistats.com/financials/YFIBuybacks.html).

## Cumulative Protocol Revenue Reaches $43M

![](image5.png)

Yearn has earned nearly $43 million in revenue, since launch (excluding the interest earned by depositors). In the past 30 days, nearly $6 million dollars in revenue has been generated by the protocol. An extrapolation of this data projects annual revenue to be nearly $70 million. 

Yearn’s cumulative revenue and other statistics are viewable [here](https://www.yfistats.com/).

## Vaults At Yearn
