## YFI Tokenomics Poll Finalized

The YFI tokenomics poll has ended with xYFI as the leading option. xYFI suggests the creation of a YFI staking vault where excess treasury earnings are to be sent.

Huge thanks to [Fin4Dao](https://twitter.com/Fin4Dao) for all the facilitation work. Check out the snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/ybaby.eth/proposal/0x783cb3d57dd59b2827f6a42967375f06504cc947ebaa3c0e495c7b29ffd47aea).



## Yearn Has Purchased $7.5M of YFI


![](image2.png)

Yearn has purchased $7,526,343 worth of YFI from the open market. We got 282.4 YFI (0.77% of total supply) at an average price of $26,651. More YFI has been bought back in the past month than in the prior year.

Now that the Treasury has more than $45 million saved up and with earnings stronger than ever, expect much more aggressive buybacks. What will you do anon?

We have also been purchasing back a significant amount of yvBOOST in order to restore the peg. Transactions can be found here: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x9d409a0a012cfba9b15f6d4b36ac57a46966ab9a?a=0x7d2aB9CA511EBD6F03971Fb417d3492aA82513f0](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9d409a0a012cfba9b15f6d4b36ac57a46966ab9a?a=0x7d2aB9CA511EBD6F03971Fb417d3492aA82513f0)

## Proposal: Evolving YFI’s Tokenomics

![](image3.png)

Step 1 is xYFI, where one stakes in the xYFI vault, earning back YFI from the treasury. 

Step 2 is veYFI, where one vote-locks YFI, with decay and time extension. Max-lock and earn disproportionate rewards compared to those who lock for shorter duration. Early exit any time but pay a penalty to the other stakers.

Step 3 is Vault gauges, where one stakes their yVault token in a gauge, earning YFI rewards, boosted by how much veYFI they have staked. Vote on which vaults should get allocated rewards. Pay a penalty to other stakers if you don't have a strong enough lock.

Step 4 is useful work, in which veYFI holders earn additional rewards by doing useful work. This is is pending the final form of the vaults v3 design. Things that it could be (but not limited to) includes configuring vault parameters, setting fees, providing insurance.

The proposal asks that the mandate is given to developers to implement these high level designs at their discretion. Once rolled out, only xYFI and later veYFI would be eligible to vote in Yearn Governance.

What will the rewards be, you ask? The treasury is buying back more YFI than ever, and expect to be able to direct $35-45m to buybacks per year. At a YFI price of $30k, that's 100 YFI/month.

Read all the details in the proposal [here](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/proposal-evolving-yfi-tokenomics/11994), get involved, and let us know what you think. A big shout out to all the participants on the forum, Discord, and Telegram chats who helped shape the form of this proposal over the past two months.

## Report: Reborn As A Black Hole

![](image4.png)

Ape Froman has recently published a report detailing a comprehensive overview of Yearn, and he details the recent tokenomics troubles at Yearn, potential fixes, and further integrations of the YFI token into the greater DeFi ecosystem. This will allow better value capture for holders and allow for a potential imbalance in the circulating supply of YFI - thus driving demand.

Special thanks to [Ape Froman](https://medium.com/@portiadog) for the thoughtful writeup. Check out the full piece [here](https://medium.com/@portiadog/yfi-reborn-as-a-black-hole-db249b90ed5a).
