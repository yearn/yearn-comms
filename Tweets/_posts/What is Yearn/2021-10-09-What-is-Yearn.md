## 1/n

People had difficulty understanding ETH in mid-2020. It wasn’t clear what the use case would be, TVL was at $8bn and hadn’t grown much in 18 months. Even out of those who believed in Ethereum, there was scepticism around how value would accrue to ETH.

## 2/n

Fast forward to today and it’s clear there’s a lot that can be built on Ethereum (DeFi, NFTs and gaming), TVL has sky-rocketed to over $100bn and throw in a token burn mechanism and people understand how value accrues to the native token.

## 3/n

In some ways the perception of Yearn today is similar to that of ETH in mid-2020, at least in terms of uncertainty over what will be built on Yearn, its future growth and value accrual to YFI. Even Yearn’s OGs are getting restless. [pic.twitter.com/TQDFz74CFc](https://twitter.com/Wot_Is_Goin_On/status/1446540013576065026/photo/1)

## 4/n

Yearn’s TVL has reached an all-time high of over $5bn TVL, achieving this without offering incentives. This is higher than the much-hyped Avalanche and Polygon that trade at multiples compared to YFI.

## 5/n

Its vaults have been integrated into Badger, Enzyme Finance, Argent Wallet, [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) and the MEW Wallet app on Android. Making vaults widely accessible is a great start, but Yearn is waiting for its killer dapp.

## 6/n

The first dapp built on Yearn to get product market fit was Alchemix’s self-repaying loans. The sudden jumps in yvDai in early 2021 shown below happened as Yearn had to quickly increase the limits of its most popular vault to keep up with the demand.

## 7/n

[@PoolTogether\_](https://twitter.com/PoolTogether_)’s no-loss lottery also opted to earn yield with Yearn. In the UK there’s over £100bn ($140bn) in premium bonds where the lottery distributes a depressing 1% annual yield.

## 8/n

If [@element_fi](https://twitter.com/element_fi) can crack fixed income, with Yearn’s vaults (the “yv” tokens) in the background, then we’re talking a total addressable market in the trillions. [pic.twitter.com/R7mkC8h7Bq](https://twitter.com/Wot_Is_Goin_On/status/1446540026507038731/photo/1)

[@ribbonfinance](https://twitter.com/ribbonfinance)’s put-selling vaults leverage DeFi’s composability so that the USDC is earning a yield with Yearn in the background. [pic.twitter.com/uwU1uyaM6a](https://twitter.com/Wot_Is_Goin_On/status/1446540030340644870/photo/1)

[@longlongfinance](https://twitter.com/longlongfinance) is also available to diversify your principal and yield into different assets.

## 11/n

Despite all the interesting protocols so far, the protocols that bring the greatest adoption to Yearn probably haven’t been built yet but there’s plenty of teams working on it. [pic.twitter.com/cIHKjDL7Kr](https://twitter.com/Wot_Is_Goin_On/status/1446540036019736576/photo/1)

## 12/n

With Yearn going multi-chain there’s potential for different types of dapps on each chain. [twitter.com/iearnfinance/s…](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1446243257336229912?s=20)

And Yearn has heeded the call. 📯

Today, we go multichain with the launch of Iron Bank Fantom and the first Fantom vaults on [beta.yearn.finance](http://beta.yearn.finance)🧵 [pic.twitter.com/IaAtDqdkYi](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1446243257336229912/photo/1)

## 13/n

The people calling for the death of DeFi on Ethereum may need to zoom out. Yearn’s Q3 2021 TVL was $4.6bn, nearly 300% higher than 12 months before. Q3 2021 annualised revenue was over $60m, up nearly 400% over the year. [pic.twitter.com/T2ivxDR0Ek](https://twitter.com/Wot_Is_Goin_On/status/1446540042210512906/photo/1)

## 14/n

The criticism around lack of value accrual is one that can be easily fixed. However, the challenge is to design tokenomics that incentivize growth and sustainability of the protocol in terms of contributors and TVL, as well as value accrual.

## 15/n

It took Ethereum 5+ years to implement EIP-1559, and 2022 brings the migration to PoS that will reward ETH stakers instead of miners. And when cartoon animals are incentivized to figure things out, things usually get figured out.

## 16/n

The sustainability of liquidity mining and competition on fees, and the pace of innovation in DeFi, mean that nothing is guaranteed of course!

## 17/n

But these worries can be brushed aside safe in the knowledge that this guy deployed Yearn’s first smart contract.
