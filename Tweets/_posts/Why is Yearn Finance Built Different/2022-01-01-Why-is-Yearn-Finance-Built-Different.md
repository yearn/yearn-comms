It’s 2022, time to re-analyze your DeFi bets. Here's a thread on some of the questions you might ask of some key DeFi categories and why [@iearnfinance](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance) is built different. Not Financial Advice.

---

##### 2

DEXes - bringing LPs and traders together. What makes your DEX special? Better formula than xy=k? No VCs? Multi-chain? Tiny market cap on a new chain the rotatooors haven’t got to yet? Solved [insert feature here]? The best UI? Fashionable tokenomics? Lots to choose from.

---

##### 3

Lending protocols. What makes your lending protocol special? More assets? More secure? Better oracles? More chains? Isolated lending? A mobile app? Do borrowers pay more interest than lenders receive after token emissions? Watch out for vanity metrics like incentivized TVL.

---

##### 4

Perpetual protocols – bringing market makers and leveraged traders together. Is a focus on performance at the cost of composability the right approach? Order book or virtual AMM? Multi-chain? Lots to choose from.

---

##### 5

Options protocols – bringing options market makers and traders together. Clearly a huge TAM. Will any actually succeed in getting users and liquidity this year? Lots to choose from.

---

##### 6

Stablecoin protocols – collateralized, algorithmic, a little bit of both, or maybe stable is out of fashion. Plans to conquer Asia, or maybe Venezuela? Focusing on real-world assets or leveraging up in DeFi? New tokenomics? Lots to choose from.

---

##### 7

Protocols that specialize in one strategy – giving more experienced DeFi users an opportunity to take on more risk for greater returns. Uniswap v3 strategies. Milk the veToken strategies. Passive options strategies. Solving impermanent loss strategies. Lots to choose from.

---

##### 8

The (maybe multiple) winners in each of the categories above will likely create enormous value, but picking winners is difficult.

---

##### 9

Yearn is different. Whilst Yearn is usually labelled as a “yield aggregator” this can lead to the idea that a team works on generating a yield. Even worse it's sometimes considered a simple CRV farmer. This is not a useful way to understand Yearn.

---

##### 10

There are currently significant constraints on yield generation such as a small pool of people who can build strategies, high gas fees limiting certain strategies, lack of battled-tested protocols to build strategies and a lack of ways to automate processes.

---

##### 11

Rather than wait for these constraints to ease (and they already are with more strategists being on-boarded, other chains and L2s with low fees), Yearn has been quietly building infrastructure to optimize the interaction between protocols, strategists and capital at scale.

---

##### 12

Yearn has been building the machine that builds the machine of yield aggregation (to paraphrase Mr. Musk), ready for a world of an ever-increasing number of tokens, complex protocols, chains, strategists, tooling and capital.

---

##### 13

With $7bn of DeFi hacks in 2021 the primary focus has been on security.

---

##### 14

Most DeFi protocols limit financial risks by tweaking parameters (e.g. lending protocols reduce the loan-to-collateral value of riskier assets), and minimize technological risks by focusing on one thing (e.g. lending).

---

##### 15

Yearn does DeFi the hard way as it combines multiple protocols and strategies within a single vault. Other protocols boast about the number of audits they've done. Yearn's yAcademy is training the next generation of auditors - helping speed up the approval of new strategies.

---

##### 16

After security comes capital efficiency – figuring out how a vault should be split across lending protocols, LPs, leveraged farm opportunities and other strategies to optimize the risk-adjusted returns. And then trying to automate it.

---

##### 17

Part of the reason behind YFI's "fair launch" was the realization that producing a high risk-adjusted yield for the trillions of dollars sitting in TradFi would be too much work for one team. The YFI boarding school is now training first-time strategists.

---

##### 18

Scalability requires reducing manual processes - buybacks, harvests, changing the strategy weightings, hedging after price movements. It's no coincidence Andre created [@thekeep3r](https://twitter.com/thekeep3r). There's even a data analysis group working on the optimal time to do buybacks.

---

##### 19

Co-ordination with decentralization – how do you build a system that incentivizes people who’ve never met to make all this happen? [@coordinape](https://twitter.com/coordinape) helps - a tool whose origins go back to a Yearn group that first ran into the problem - is now being used by countless DAOs.

---

##### 20

Each new DeFi protocol creates a potential opportunity for a strategist. The new strategy improves the risk-adjusted yield for the vaults which incentivizes more capital, leading to more fees which can be used to build this beast of a platform.

The examples in this thread show how Yearn is attempting to solve the generalized problems in DeFi. The term "DeFi protocol" doesn't seem to do it justice, maybe Yearn could be better described as a fintech DAO...
