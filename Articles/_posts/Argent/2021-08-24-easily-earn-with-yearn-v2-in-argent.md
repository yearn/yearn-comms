# Easily earn with Yearn v2 in Argent

![](Image1.jpg)

Yearn V2 Vaults are now just a tap away in Argent! Earn up to 16.47% Net APY\* with automated yield generation. This builds on our existing support for Yearn's [V1 Vaults](https://www.argent.xyz/blog/yearn-vaults-in-argent/).

## **Benefits of using Yearn with Argent**

Earning with [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/vaults) through Argent is unique because of its:

- **Simplicity**: Only one transaction required. (No need for a separate approval).
- **Security**: No infinite token approvals; you automatically only approve what you need to spend. You also have peace of mind that you're interacting with the right contracts.

We've launched with 7 Vaults (USDC, DAI, SNX, 1INCH, YFI, WBTC, USDT, UNI, ETH).

## **Why Yearn matters**

Yearn has grown at a [monumental pace](https://defipulse.com/yearn.finance) since its launch in early 2020. Yearn makes it easy for anyone to "yield farm" (trying to maximize the return on your assets by utilizing multiple DeFi protocols). Yearn compare their approach to passive investing.

There's also a big benefit when it comes to Ethereum network fees ('gas'). Gas is "socialized" across everyone using that Vault making it much more economical for the average user.

[Strategies](https://medium.com/yearn-state-of-the-vaults/the-vaults-at-yearn-9237905ffed3) are proposed by the community and voted on by Yearn's governance.

With V2, each Vault can employ multiple strategies, whereas V1 Vaults used just one each.

## **Risks**

As always in crypto and DeFi, you should do your own research on the risks. These include smart contracts and the economics of the protocols. Yearn's audits can be found [here](https://docs.yearn.finance/resources/audits).

\*APY is variable and the concept does not technically directly apply as it does in centralized finance. Please see [Yearn's explanation](https://docs.yearn.finance/resources/guides/how-to-understand-yvault-roi#roi-calculation) for more.
