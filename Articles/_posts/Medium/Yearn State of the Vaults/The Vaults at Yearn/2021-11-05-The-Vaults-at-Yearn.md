# The Vaults at Yearn

Updated November 5th, 2021

# Overview

Welcome to The Vaults at Yearn, where you can find in-depth information about how Yearn‚Äôs yVaults operate and the actions (strategies) these vaults perform. This article will maintain a one-stop location for all yVault descriptions. All version 1 yVaults have been deprecated, and any in production are now on version 2. The newest yVaults and strategies are denoted with ‚ú®.

Below you will find 7 sections:

# Ethereum Vaults Œû

Yearn Finance started and has the majority of its yVaults running on Ethereum Mainnet. We have deployed over 250 strategies and 100 yVaults on Ethereum. The ones that are currently running in production you can find in the sections below.

## Yearn and Curve Synergy üîµü§ùüåà

One of the critical components of Yearn‚Äôs infrastructure includes a collaborative relationship with [Curve.fi](http://curve.fi/). Several Yearn vaults provide liquidity into Curve pools and stake the liquidity provider (LP) tokens into the respective gauges, earning CRV rewards. Yearn locks 10% of all CRV rewards earned into the yveCRV-DAO (‚ÄúBackscratcher‚Äù) to obtain an additional amount of CRV. In the strategy descriptions below, vaults that are boosted are indicated with a üöÄ.

For a deeper understanding, refer to the _Understanding Curve Boost Multipliers_ section near the end of this document.

Furthermore, the remaining 90% of the CRV earned are swapped into the respective LP tokens, and re-deposited into the vault. The only exception is the yvUSDN3Crv vault that locks 50% of the CRV earned into the Backscratcher vault and swaps the remaining 50%.

### veCRV-DAO yVault ([yveCRV-DAO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc5bDdf9843308380375a611c18B50Fb9341f502A))

_AKA-Backscratcher_ [üì∫](https://youtu.be/kJEAe2Rlh70)  
This vault converts your CRV into yveCRV, earning you a continuous share of Curve fees which are boosted over what you earn staking at Curve. The more CRV converted, the greater your weekly rewards. Every Friday, these can be claimed from the vault as 3Crv (Curve‚Äôs 3pool LP token).

Yearn, itself, deposits 10% of all CRV earned into this vault and gives its 3crv rewards to vault token holders which is where the boosted weekly rewards come from.

Depositing is non-reversible: You can only convert CRV into yveCRV, as the CRV is perpetually staked in Curve‚Äôs voting escrow. All vaults send 10% of earned CRV to this vault to sustain boost levels.

## Vaults üèõÔ∏è

v2 yVaults are able to employ multiple strategies per vault (up to 20 strategies simultaneously), unlike v1 yVaults that are only able to employ one strategy per vault. [üì∫](https://youtu.be/ZES91i-hNAM)

This vault accepts [yveCRV-DAO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc5bDdf9843308380375a611c18B50Fb9341f502A) tokens, which grant you a continuous share of Curve‚Äôs trading fees (claimed weekly as [3Crv](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6c3F90f043a72FA612cbac8115EE7e52BDe6E490), Curve‚Äôs 3pool LP token). Rewards are harvested, swapped for more yveCRV-DAO (either via market-buy or mint, depending on which is most efficient at time of harvest), and deposited back into the vault.

## Understanding Curve üöÄ Boost Multipliers

Using the crvCOMP pool, as an example, liquidity providers earn approximately 12.82% APY in trading fees, and an additional 24.72% APY (as of the date of this publication) in the form of CRV rewards, if they stake their liquidity provider tokens in the Curve gauge.

Depositors can boost the CRV rewards earned by locking CRV into the voting escrow module, with a max boost of **2.5x**. This size of the boost is dependent on the amount of CRV locked in the voter escrow, and the size of the deposit in the liquidity pool, however, this [calculator](https://dao.curve.fi/minter/calc) is useful in modeling potential boost multipliers. The max boost for the crvCOMP pool yields an additional 61.81% APY in the form of CRV rewards, which is displayed below.

Yearn stakes the Curve liquidity provider token into the gauge to earn CRV rewards. 10% of these rewards are locked in our yveCRV-DAO vault (described above) to boost the rewards of all yVaults with Curve strategies.
