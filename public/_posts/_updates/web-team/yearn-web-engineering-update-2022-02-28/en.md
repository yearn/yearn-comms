#### Week of February 28, 2022

## **Summary üåÖ**

You can tell spring is in the air by the amount of change happening in the Web3 space. Iron Bank has branched out independently from Yearn‚Äôs UI; they‚Äôve developed an awesome site (app.ib.xyz) as their team sets out to provide a streamlined user experience. Zapper was temporarily brought down due to surging API calls (and a memory leak) which gave our token balances a bit of a headache. This issue made us reconsider our reliance on 3rd party applications which was reflected in our retrospective. We‚Äôre looking forward to our planning cycle next week to hopefully decouple ourselves from outside reliance and and ensure our Front End is more resilient than ever.
