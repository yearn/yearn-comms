## **Ongoing Focus and Outstanding Issues**

- Cycle Focus: Web Security

  - In response to the increasing sophistication of front-end attacks on DeFi protocols, we have spent the last several weeks designing and implementing several improvements to Yearn's web security, including monitoring, real-time verification, and implementation of a web multisig. More details to follow upon release.

- Vault migration bug

  - Some users have reported an issue when migrating vaults requiring a page refresh for their new vault balance to appear. While this issue has proven a bit difficult to replicate, engineers are debugging this week.
