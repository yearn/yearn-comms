#### Week of February 21, 2022

## **Summary**

Arbitrum is officially launched for Yearn. Currently there is only one vault employing one strategy (shout out curve’s tricrypto.) We’ve learned from the growing pains we went through with Fantom to deliver a smoother roll out; for our users, our strategists, and our engineers.

Our team continues to expand as we add chains, strategies, and vaults. We’ve brought in additional project managers and product owners to help wrangle the work and keep our community engaged.
