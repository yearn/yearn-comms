#### Week of January 31, 2022

## **Summary**

A few weeks of housekeeping as we wrap up Jan 2022:

- Support for Arbitrum has been included in a recent release for the main site as well as YearnWatch. With a bit more testing Yearn will be ready to launch vaults and strategies on our 3rd chain.
- The web team also faced some growing pains as we tackled the largest spike of unique user visits we’ve ever had. This spawned the growth of an infrastructure team with more details to come.
- Web and strategists teamed up to begin overhauling our APY: add more data, make it more usable to users, and make it more accessible visually.
- Finally, we’ve had a nice push of new contributors helping with issues in multiple web repos.

## **Accomplishments ✅**

## **Ongoing Focus and Outstanding Issues**

**Cycle Focus 🎯**

- We decided to keep previous themes of security and stability this cycle as we realign our cycle schedule. End to end testing has proven more than useful along with alert bots to update the team with any errors or performance issues.

**Current issues 🐛**

- Fantom RPC. While this isn’t specific to Yearn it continues to affect users. Yearn has shifted our infra to a self-hosted node, which hopefully should smooth out any previous issues users experienced with the public RPC.
- APY calculations continue to be a source of questions, especially on Fantom. New additions to the yearn-exporter repo are almost complete, and will provide:
    - Per-strategy forward-looking (Curve/Convex) and prior harvest (all other vaults) APY
    - Weekly, monthly, and since inception APY snapshots at the vault level.
    - To display all of these new numbers, we will be adding a very basic stats page. 📊
