## **YIP-63 Results**

![](/_posts/_newsletters/Yearn-Finance-Newsletter-44/image2.jpg?w=1456&h=690)

The recent vote for YIP-63 has resulted in agreement for the funding of the LeXpunK DAO Yearn has transferred one million DAI to a multisig controlled by Curve Finance, Lido Finance, and LeXpunK DAO.

For context, the LeXpunK DAO is a coalition of DeFi builders and lawyers with the goal of creating a legal defense team far greater and more ethically aligned than those at Silicon Valley venture funds. This is an important initiative that will serve to fight for crypto over the next few years or even decades.

Read the full proposal on Yearn’s forum [here](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-63-fund-builder-first-legal-activism-dao/11280).

Check Yearn’s transaction to the DAO [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0ec0fc55d6dc51b426a254bf2d6de138b1b9a1c3031f4ab3a7b39439fa004392)

## **Product User Survey**

We have released a new user survey to gauge what you, the community at Yearn, would like to see added.  

Yearn is always iterating amongst ourselves and with the help of the community, but with this survey, we’d like to take a more hands on approach to seeing what you guys, the community, has in mind to improve Yearn. We have seen exponential growth in the short time we’ve been active, and we hope to continue innovating in the products we put out and add more utility to the YFI token. We think that we can improve the user experience at Yearn tenfold with the help of your thoughts, and thus become the most competitive in the yield aggregation space among the various other sectors we engage in.

## **Introducing Four New yVaults**

![](/_posts/_newsletters/Yearn-Finance-Newsletter-44/image3.jpg?w=611&h=298)

Four new yVaults are now live on our UI. Deposit today and earn yield on your AAVE, COMP, TUSD, and SUSHI  

The AAVE, COMP, and SUSHI vaults are earning yield from single-sided staking pools on [universe.xyz](https://universe.xyz/polymorphs), with no exposure to impermanent loss. TUSD is earning yield from Kashi on SushiSwap.

You can view the latest APYs for these vaults and deposit to these vaults using this [link](https://yearn.finance/vaults).

## **Yearn Integrated In Defi Saver**

![](/_posts/_newsletters/Yearn-Finance-Newsletter-44/image4.jpg?w=1012&h=506)

YFI has been integrated into the Defi Saver Recipe Creator. With this integration, you can deposit any supported assets into Yearn vaults using DeFi Saver, as well as combine this action with any other protocol interactions. Some examples are detailed below.  

First, you can create a MakerDAO Vault and deposit the borrowed DAI into Yearn, all in one single transaction. The Stability fee for ETH-A in Maker is 2% and the current NET APY for the DAI Yearn Vault is ~6.5%. The recipe can be found [here](https://app.defisaver.com/recipes/create?recipe=V3JhcEV0aEFjdGlvbiwyMDtSZWZsZXhlck9wZW5TYWZlQWN0aW9uLEVUSC1BO1JlZmxleGVyU3VwcGx5QWN0aW9uLCQyLHJlY2lwZSxBbGwgYXZhaWxhYmxlO1JlZmxleGVyR2VuZXJhdGVBY3Rpb24sJDIsNjY2NixyZWNpcGU7U2VsbEFjdGlvbiwweDAzYWI0NTg2MzQ5MTBhYWQyMGVmNWYxYzhlZTk2ZjFkNmFjNTQ5MTkscmVjaXBlLDY2NjYsMHhBMGI4Njk5MWM2MjE4YjM2YzFkMTlENGEyZTlFYjBjRTM2MDZlQjQ4LHJlY2lwZSwxO1llYXJuU3VwcGx5QWN0aW9uLDB4QTBiODY5OTFjNjIxOGIzNmMxZDE5RDRhMmU5RWIwY0UzNjA2ZUI0OCxyZWNpcGUsQWxsIGF2YWlsYWJsZSx3YWxsZXQ%3D).

Alternatively, you can open a Reflexer ETH Safe and borrow RAI. The Stability fee in Reflexer is -0.5% and you can swap the RAI for a higher yielding asset, USDC or DAI, and deposit into Yearn.
