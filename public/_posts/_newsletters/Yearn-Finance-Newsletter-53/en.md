# Transparency at Yearn

# More transparency. More alpha.

Two new tools from Yearn illuminating the mysterious depths of the rabbit hole are the [content aggregator](https://blog.yearn.finance/) and the [vault encyclopedia](https://vaults.yearn.finance/).

With the content aggregator, you can find all the most important information coming from Yearn. Go to one link for the latest announcements, tweets, newsletters, articles, and quarterly financials from Yearn. You’ll also find unrolled big brain twitter threads from Yearn contributors like tracheopteryx

With the new community-created encyclopedia on Yearn vaults, you can find in-depth information about how yVaults operate and review the actions/strategies these vaults perform.

Once hosted on Medium, the new vault site adds filters, multichain coverage, auto-updating content, and (coming soon) support for multiple languages!

Read more about the tools here. Thanks to @0xMajor, @KoxEvan, and DarkGhosty for their amazing work on the vault encyclopedia.

# Yearn Web Updates

In an effort to increase transparency, several contributors to Yearn's web ecosystem have started a newsletter that will collect new features, ongoing issues, and planned updates, in addition to periodic deep-dives on the web tech stack.

Major points from this release include improved UX and speed when switching networks, including a prompt to add Fantom in your wallet if necessary and improved support for Fantom in yearn-exporter

As always, if you have feedback or suggestions for the website, or would like to contribute, reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yearn).

yAcademy dao is managed by its full-time members and active contributors, with oversight and guidance from the ethereum security alliance members.

# Yearn Has Received An Additional 1M FTM Grant From the Fantom Foundation

Welcome to 2022, anon. The donations continue.

Yearn has received another grant from the Fantom Foundation

Once again, we don't dump. 208,333 FTM have been donated, with 90%+ to the FTM vault and a proportional donation to other Fantom vaults.

We will continue this with future grants.
