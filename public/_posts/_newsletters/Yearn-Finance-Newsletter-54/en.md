# Introducing Seven New Fantom Vaults

On Fantom, these seven vaults join the mix: WBTC, WETH, SPELL, DOLA, Curve Tricrypto, Curve Geist, and CRV

Meanwhile, with nearly $400M TVL in Fantom vaults, we're still seeing juicy APYs, up to over 45%. Most of the Fantom vaults utilize folding on Scream, with Geist Finance and Tarot Finance strategies arriving imminently

# New Curve Vaults Live

On Ethereum, the following new Curve vaults are live now: CVX-ETH, CRV-ETH, 3EUR, UST Wormhole, USDPax, DOLA, and RAI - the first vault utilizing Reflexer’s custom Curve implementation

As for 3EUR, this token represents a Curve liquidity pool. Holders earn fees from users trading in the pool, and can also deposit the LP to Curve's gauges to earn CRV emissions. This pool contains agEUR, EURT, and EURS. agEUR is a synthetic Euro issued by Angle Protocol, while EURS and EURT are both centralized, hard-pegged Euro tokens issued by Stasis and Tether, respectively.

The 3EUR strategy supplies 3EURpool-f to Convex Finance to earn CRV and CVX (and any other available tokens). Earned tokens are harvested, sold for more 3EURpool-f which is deposited back into the strategy.

# Update on yvBOOST

Most may not realize, but 1 yvBOOST collects 2.2x more weekly Curve protocol fees than 1 veCRV. yvBOOST APR is also over 100%, sustained, with 1 yvBOOST currently being 32% cheaper than 1 CRV. Even after all this, there is over $5M still to be donated to yvBOOST holders
