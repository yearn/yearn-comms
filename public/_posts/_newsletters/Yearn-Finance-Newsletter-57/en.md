# YIP-66 Has Passed

![](./image2.jpg?w=1456&h=1456)

YIP-66, which covers a compensation plan for Yearn and hopes to achieve autonomy in its plan, has recently passed the voting stage and will be integrated into the Yearn protocol.

In just Q4 2021, contributing Strategists earned $5,142,137 in performance fees net, and to manage this scale of payments, YIP-65 is designated as being the one size fits all fix for Yearn’s DAO system.

On the contrary, some argue that the proposal overcomplicates the current compensation process, creates tax issues, or disregards how well Strategists currently work. All of this is intended to be worked on and addressed now that the vote has passed, with goals of  more efficient DAO management in place.

We invite you to engage, give feedback, and participate in the Yearn community by joining us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/8rF374XkXy), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/iearnfinance), or [Github](http://github.com/yearn) . Come build with us.

# Security at Yearn

![](./image5.jpg?w=945&h=408)

Here at Yearn, we take security extremely seriously in hopes of giving our users the best risk-adjusted yields in DeFi.

Recently, Yearn has paid a $200,000 bounty to whitehat who disclosed a vulnerability via Immunefi. The vulnerability has since been fixed and the strategy has been rewritten within two weeks.

Read the vulnerability disclosure [here](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/blob/master/disclosures/2022-01-30.md). Earn up to $200,000 per bounty at [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/yearnfinance/) and check out the EthDenver bounties [here](https://www.ethdenver.com/bounties/yearn-finance).

# How Yearn Strategies Are Endorsed

![](./image6.jpg?w=1400&h=707)

Following on from the previous [Yearn Vaults and Strategies](https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-finance-explained-what-are-vaults-and-strategies-96970560432) article, this one covers the process of vetting a newly proposed strategy.

First, a Strategist must come up with a due diligence document stating basic protocol risks. Then, they can deploy a strategy via the [Yearn template](https://github.com/yearn/brownie-strategy-mix) which is then deployed on the ape.tax site. After a few harvests, the Safe Farming Committee at Yearn approves the strategy alongside other internal reviewers.

After feedback is given and concerns are addressed, the new strategy can be deployed in production on the [yearn.finance](http://yearn.finance/) website. New strategists will earn 10% performance fees, and with certain milestones there are tasks they must complete. At 10M TVL, 3 people are needed to actively monitor the strategy. At over 100M TVL, an external audit company and internal reviewers will consistently vet the strategy.
