## **ALPHA and YFI Liquidity Providers Eligible For A Special NFT**

![](/_posts/_newsletters/Yearn-Finance-Newsletter-45/image2.jpg?w=1456&h=1729)

Liquidity providers for the Uniswap ETH/YFI and Sushiswap ETH/YFI pools in Alpha Homora V2 pools will be eligible for a special NFT drop courtesy of Yearn, Alpha, and Project Galaxy.

This drop will last 3 full days, from 9/3-9/9. Users that open/have existing positions in eligible pools will be able to claim their NFT on Project Galaxy's website [here](https://galaxy.eco/AlphaFinanceLab/campaign/117).

Note that users will only be able to claim their NFT during the window and must claim with the wallet address that has the positions currently open

## **Reminder To Migrate To V2**

As v2 has been live for months, the v1 vaults have been deprecated and strategies have been shut down, with users still in the vaults earning no yield. These vaults have served the DeFi community over a year as a reliable source of yield, and now, it's time for an upgrade. As a reminder, our v2 vaults entail several changes such as deploying capital across several strategies for more efficiency and better risk-adjusted yield. You can migrate to v2 at any time without fees.

Check out the vaults here at [yearn.finance/vaults](https://yearn.finance/vaults).

## **How To Swap Into Yearn Vaults**

One of the best ways to do Yearn Vaults swaps funds from one vault to another is typically using [curve.fi](https://curve.fi/) or with zaps built into Yearn's UI. This is gas efficient, but may cost extra in slippage or additional fees.

Another way of migrating funds from Compound and AAVE to Yearn is with the use of [bowswap.finance](https://bowswap.finance/). It lets you withdraw from the protocol and deposit into a Yearn vault, with it additionally showing both protocol's APYs for comparison and allowing you to select multiple tokens at a time. No extra fees!

## **Cumulative Protocol Revenue Reaches $39M**

Yearn has earned over $39 million in revenue, since launch (excluding the interest earned by depositors). In the past 30 days, over $5 million dollars in revenue has been generated by the protocol. An extrapolation of this data projects annual revenue to be nearly $30 million.

Yearn's cumulative revenue and other statistics are viewable [here](https://www.yfistats.com/).
