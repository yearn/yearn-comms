The Blue Pill
A spiritual guide for the past, present, and future

The Blue Pill
PAST • PRESENT • FUTURE

WHAT IS
YEARN?

WHERE DID
YEARN COME FROM?

WHERE IS YEARN
GOING?

“We are like a baby bird just hatched.
No one designed Yearn. It emerged
from Andre's gift of all the YFI.
It's sink or swim for us. The cells
of Yearn either learn how to pulse
together and move feathers and
wings, or we die in the nest.”

PROLOGUE

IN THE LAND OF
BLUE PILLS
EVERYTHING
YOU THOUGHT
WAS IMPORTANT
CEASES TO
MATTER

YOUR TITLE
YOUR NET WORTH
YOUR NATIONALITY
YOUR DEGREES
YOUR LOOKS
EVEN YOUR NAME

All that matters
is your contribution
This book is an
invitation to
contribute

IT IS THE HAND BECKONING
FROM THE GAP YOU’VE NEVER NOTICED IN THE HEDGES

Will you take the well-worn
paths of yesterday? It asks
Or do you wish to go
somewhere new?

The Yearn Blue Pill has
one overriding goal:
to communicate
Yearn’s vision

But how do you
do that from
within a network
with no leader?

HOW DO YOU
UNITE THE VIEWS
OF HUNDREDS
OF DIVERSE
CONTRIBUTORS
FROM AROUND
THE WORLD?

THE SHORT
ANSWER IS,
YOU CAN’T

We’re all here for
different reasons
We all have
different goals

But through candid
discussions with the community,
we’ve found common ground

This document is
the result of those
conversations
We recognize
these pages as
dangerous

Naming our vision
could limit us
And we are
limitless

But today, one year
after the birth of YFI
We’ve recognized the
time has come
We’re putting our
vision on paper

So that when forks arise
in the road, there is a place
contributors can go
To get an answer to
the question:

Is this Yearn?
Or is it not?

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Part One: Past 27
Part Two: Present 59
Part Three: Future 81
PART ONE: PAST

Every contributor to Yearn has a story,
arc, or journey
And we must begin
with the story
of the first
Andre Cronje

In 2018, he studied every major crypto project’s code
He read their Githubs line-by-line
He published reviews for all to read

And in that process, he found the
truth: that most projects were
built on lies and hype
They were forks with fancy names
or forks of forks that didn’t do
what they promised
But some of them were
altogether different
Some of them
inspired him to build

In 2019, Andre put
on his coveralls
and became
a yield farmer

But he was not your typical yield farmer
(doing things by hand)
He tended his crops with code
He built and automated all of his
processes directly on Ethereum
And by doing so, he built the
world’s first yield aggregator

It was a perpetual
yield machine
(DEPOSIT FUNDS AND WATCH THEM GROW)

Hello, world!
On Feb. 4, 2020, Andre announced the birth of
iearn.finance (which would become Yearn)
“Don’t do it the way I did it, which was hard,
cost me a lot of money, and has created very
little network effect,” he wrote

But, the world has a way of
finding things of value
It saw iEarn, and saw
that it was good
And capital came flooding in

“I TEST IN PROD,”
ANDRE PROCLAIMED
BE WARNED
iEARN WAS NOT AUDITED
IT WAS “DANGEROUS”
AND IT WAS
REVOLUTIONARY

The revolutionaries noticed
One by one, they came…
new contributors with
fantastical names

(THE BUNNY)

(THE GHOST)

(THE DUDE)

(THE BIRD)

(THE GLASS OF MILK)

They weren’t merely interested
in finance; they were
interested in the FUTURE

They saw what this experimental
project could become:
a gargantuan, unstoppable,
extra-governmental,
decentralized, permissionless,
self-healing, collective organism
with a heart pumping yield to
the rhythm of each new block

A ubiquitous yield-layer to
underpin every financial
instrument on the planet −
no banks or middlemen with
golden cufflinks required

They wanted to contribute and
they asked to get involved
They helped iEarn
morph into Yearn
They suffered attacks, hacks,
and scathing criticisms

But they worked together…
United across the globe by an
unspoken sense of purpose

“It has been amazingly fun to
face all these challenges,
and each one I believe has
created a more robust ecosystem,”
Andre wrote on February 4, 2020.
“Looking forward to many
more problems to come”

At Yearn, contributors don’t shy
away from the hard things,
they seek them out
Remember: they hide
opportunities
There’s a philosophy in
Andre’s message:
Look forward to problems

PROBLEMS ARE
THE CLAY WE USE
TO MOLD THE
FUTURE

On July 17, 2020, Andre announced
he was giving away control
Anyone providing liquidity on Yearn could
earn YFI, a brand new governance token
(pronounced “wifey”) that granted holders
power over the platform’s future
“The control is in your hands,” Andre said
“Good luck”

“The roots of Yearn are in the gift,”
one contributor said
“Andre’s fair launch was a revolutionary act
that put generosity in the DNA of
the whole community,” another said
Yearn doesn’t ask what it can extract
It asks what it can give away
Not three months later
it was clear the experiment
had become something
much larger than any
one contributor
It was a movement
“I am not Yearn,”
Andre wrote

“Consider how big the ecosystem has become, consider all
the websites, tooling, newsletters, forum, Discord, Telegram,
and active development on Github. None of these are done by
myself. I am a rapid prototyper and I will continue to be one.”

“The Yearn team is far more skilled and capable than I am,
and anyone that thinks Yearn is dictated, led, or in any way
dependent on me, is doing Yearn a disservice. I am happy
to be a contributor to something much bigger.”
“I don’t foresee builders stopping, and I will continue to build.
Some of it will be useful, some of it will end up failures.
But I think there is more value in trying, even if it is
a failure, than all the critics deeming it so.”

There are few things in the
world more powerful
than the gift
Andre Cronje gave
away all the YFI
Every
Single
One

Over a billion dollars in value
The inflaton field from this cosmic gift has left
an indelible mark on the collective
Its vibrations echo
in every one of us
It called us here
Not for money
Not for fame
But because that’s what gifts do
They are magic
Andre cast a spell into this world woven with
integrity, genius, and generosity
And Yearn was what he summoned

PART TWO: PRESENT

Question: What is Yearn?
An innovation factory?
A yield-aggregator protocol?
An intersubjective life-form?
Something else, entirely?
Question: Who can contribute to Yearn?
Answer: You
Whoever you are, wherever you are,
you may know what Yearn is
better than we do
Come show us

Yearn is an emergent
and evolving experiment
in decentralized collaboration
It has no papers of incorporation,
no headquarters, nor even a list
of names and locations for
its contributors

Yearn is open
Everything it builds is visible
Yearn is post-corporate…
a place where you never have
to sell yourself because your
contributions speak for you

AT YEARN, YOUR WORK
IS NOT ASSIGNED
IT IS GUIDED BY YOUR INNER VOICE

Question: What if the most radical component of Yearn
isn’t the yield machine? The machine, after all, is
a technical apparatus constructed of code
It cannot exist without its
network of hearts and minds

Perhaps the network itself is the
Most radical part of Yearn
Our unique DAO (DECENTRALIZED AUTONOMOUS ORGANIZATION)
and those who embody it

In October 2020,
Yearn contributors
laid out a manifesto
First, it named what Yearn is not:

YEARN IS NOT
A COMPANY
YEARN DOES NOT
HAVE INVESTORS
YEARN DOES NOT
CATER TO SPECULATORS

YEARN DOES NOT
HAVE AN OFFICIAL VOICE
YEARN IS NOT
OWED ANYTHING
FROM ANYONE

Then, it named what
Yearn is:

YEARN IS A COLLECTIVE
OF CONTRIBUTORS
YEARN IS EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY
YEARN IS FOR BUILDERS
YEARN IS FOR
SELF-STARTERS

YEARN IS FOR
COLLABORATORS
YEARN IS INFLUENCED
BY MERIT
YEARN IS GOVERNED BY YFI,
BUT YFI DOES NOT GOVERN
YEARN’S CONTRIBUTORS

YEARN IS
CONSTANTLY EVOLVING

AND FINALLY:
“WHAT YEARN IS TODAY,
MAY NOT BE WHAT IT
IS TOMORROW −
WHAT YOU DO AFTER
READING THIS MAY
CHANGE YEARN FOREVER.
IT’S UP TO YOU.”

Yearn has contributors who
haven’t written a line of code and
others who have spent decades
developing software
Both groups ask,
“Am I good enough to be here?”

The answer is simple
YES
It’s not about
what’s come before,
it’s about now

We are here now
If you have fallen down Yearn’s
gravity well, there is a reason
Let’s bump against the impossible
and see if it moves

No one knows the future
(That’s because it doesn’t exist)

PART THREE: FUTURE

HERE WE ARE
THE SELF_SOVEREIGN
BEINGS OF YEARN

We are leaders and seekers who
Work in the gift to invent the future
We came from chaos and have chosen not to project the
rigid, closed, hierarchical control structures imprinted
In our collective memory into the pure
Formless space in front of us
We chose the harder path
The path of creation

And we are not the first
Decades before Satoshi, pioneering spirits had already
begun exploring the future of coordination
The writer Frederic Laloux calls these
rare endeavours Teal organizations
They have been around for decades, hidden in plain
sight, doing things you’d think were impossible:
functioning with radical transparency; working
without managers, bureaucracy, or even budgets

THESE TEAMS WORK AT
THE SPEED OF TRUST −
THE FASTEST WE CAN EVER GO
EVERYONE IS A LEADER,
DECIDING FOR THEMSELVES
HOW TO FOLLOW THE GROUP’S
EVOLUTIONARY PURPOSE

This is how we work at Yearn
We are not a machine
We are life itself
We are not Red, Amber,
Orange, or Green...
We are Teal
And we are Blue

We will chart our own course
The future of work is like a party
bike that we ride together, each
peddling as much or as little as we
want, and when someone knows
where to go next, they get to steer
And there is no map for
where we are going

To get there, we must cross the
river by feeling for stones

Our eyes won’t help us,
nor will our minds
A heart cell doesn’t know
how to climb a mountain, but
when it pumps blood and
trusts its friends, well then it
might just find the summit

Now what if I told you that each
of us is made up of whole beings,
is a whole being, and is a part
of larger whole beings?
And then what if I said that those
larger whole beings have their
own uncharted territory ahead?

Well, for those of us who have already embarked
on this journey together, we feel this future in
our bones, singing to us
Our vision isn’t a roadmap with a set
of goals and deliverables
It is this song
Yearn’s voice
(YEARN AERIAL DIVISION)

THE SOUNDLESS VOICE
OF OUR COLLECTIVE,
CALLING TO US FROM
BETWEEN THE PAGES

We are in the realm of
networks now
In DeFi (DECENTRALIZED FINANCE), and at Yearn,
this is the new world

We are not companies with closed boundaries,
corporate veils, NDAs, and non-competes —
we are permeable, overlapping network entities
sensing and responding in real time from a
thousand empowered autonomous beings

Top-down management leveraging commandand-control heirarchies are for the mahogany
boardrooms of yesteryear
And we are navigators, adventurers,
and explorers of the future
We are married to the sea

WE ARE BUILDING A SHIP
It will carry anyone who
wants to board
Any age, any gender,
any worldview
You are all welcome
You are all necessary
Find an oar and start pulling

Yearn is a ship from
the fleet of tomorrow

WE HAVE BUILT IT FROM
THE LUMBER OF
THE DARK FOREST
NOW THAT WE’RE HERE,
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE
DESTINATION DOESN’T
MATTER AT ALL

We can sail the seas of yield
aggregation, or we can
go find new dragons
We will write protocols
beyond the edge of the map

All that matters is
that we sail
