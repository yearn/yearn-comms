#### Q: Tell us a bit about yourself. How long have you been with Yearn and what team are you a part of?  

I have been contributing to Yearn since the beginning of November 2021. I was doing a bunch of things at once and then January 2022 I was able to just focus on Yearn 100%. I am part of the B2B integration team.

#### Q: Tell us a bit about what made you want to join Yearn?

I worked for a big technology company for 10 years. It was the only thing I ever did out of university, and I really enjoyed the first 8 years of that job. However, covid completely ruined it. Perks disappeared, people disappeared, new policies were introduced, and it was clear that I was a number. I wasnâ€™t able to be a doer. Someone maybe even 3 degrees of separation from me was making huge policy changes that affected me without talking to me or knowing my intentions.

There were a lot of opportunities for that company to improve and all they had to do was talk to me and listen. They decided not to. They lost a lot of business.  
That would never happen at Yearn. Someone will always listen and think and provide feedback. If something can be built or done to improve operations, I just signal my intentions and then just do it.

#### Q: What does your day with Yearn look like?

Yearn is more of a lifestyle commitment. Youâ€™re always responsible for knowing what is going on and when it comes to b2b, you must make sure partner issues and questions are responded too quickly. Every day is different. Sometimes I get an opportunity to do a lot of outreach, sometimes I am doing meetings and helping plan new partner integrations. There are always hundreds if not over 1,000 messages to check every day. I prefer 1,000 telegram messages to even 100 emails though. We donâ€™t do a lot of email communication thankfully ðŸ˜Š

So my day for Yearn basically starts first thing and ends when I go to sleep. Sure I sit at my computer a lot, but my computer can be anywhere!

#### Q: What are the most impressive parts of Yearn for you?

The quality of people working on the project. Most of the doers were top professionals in web2 before coming to Yearn. I donâ€™t know that with any certainty, but it was really obvious to me how high the bar was after looking at internal and external documentation, how problems are solved, and how dedicated everyone is to building Yearn.

#### Q: What kind of impact do you want to have not just in Yearn but across the space?

I try to evangelize borderless web3 as much as possible. For builders, for users, for anyone.

#### Q: What about the culture at Yearn do you like?

Weâ€™re all born into some completely random social contract in the physical world. It is something every human has in common. It isnâ€™t up to us and it really sucks. Yearn makes this irrelevant.

#### Q: What are some of your hobbies and interests?

I have a huge garden and I grow all kinds of foods. It is more like a very small farm. Iâ€™m really into cycling too.

#### Q: Tell us a fun fact about you!

One day I want to get a house with a pond and Iâ€™ll rehabilitate injured ducks.
