### I sat down with J, a yearn finance contributor who you likely have come across if you have perused our Discord or Telegram chats. J is admired by Yearn contributors and members of the community alike for their quick wit, diligent work ethic, willingness to go above and beyond for the community, and their top-notch meme game!

#### Q: Tell us a bit about yourself.How long have you been with Yearn and what team are you apart of? 

Yearn user turned fan turned question answerer turned contributor. I’ve been contributing to Yearn since early 2021 as part of ySupport.

#### Q: Tell us a bit about what made you want to join Yearn?

Yearn is one of the first DeFi products I’ve used and is therefore one that I’m most familiar with. I joined their Discord server wanting to learn more and found that I learned more about not only Yearn, but DeFi and many other things. It immediately felt like home.

#### Q: What does your day with Yearn look like?

It starts with browsing the multiple Telegram group chats to look for relevant updates that may help me with answering user questions. Then I visit the usual support channels on Discord and Telegram to look for any unanswered questions and issues I can answer or address. The rest of the day involves a rotation of these, checking back and forth to match issues with relevant solutions.

#### Q: What are the most impressive parts of Yearn for you?

The autonomy, the size, the several intertwined, overlapping groups, the speed and amount of work done, and how deep everything goes.

#### Q: What kind of impact do you want to have not just in Yearn but across the space?

DeFi moves so fast that taking a nap feels like you miss out for a week. I can’t imagine how intimidating all of it could be to a new user, no matter how interested one is. Incremental learning to improve understanding and eventually user experience is what I want to share with others.

#### Q: What about the culture at Yearn do you like?

Openness, acceptance, trust, respect, integrity, shitposting, anime.

#### Q: What are some of your hobbies and interests?

Music production, cats, dogs, Red Velvet, K-pop, saying “gm” in the #gm channel.
