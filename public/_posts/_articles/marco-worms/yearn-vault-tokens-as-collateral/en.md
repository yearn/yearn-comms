Using tokens as collateral is a primitive building block in DeFi: “collateral” means that the tokens are locked, and only to be unlocked once agreed-upon conditions are met (such as the repayment of a loan). An everyday use case is seen in lending platforms, which allow users to lock tokens to borrow other ones. [yvTokens can represent any yearn vault](https://docs.yearn.finance/getting-started/products/yvaults/vault-tokens), which has many valuable properties when used as collateral:

### They are yield generating

Any yvToken is the yield-bearing version of a token deposited in it, so when locked up as collateral it will still keep generating yield. A single vault token can run up to 20 yield-generating strategies. All Vaults at [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance/#/vaults) run “up-only” strategies.

### The safest yields in DeFi

Vaults strategies are constantly audited to practice the highest security standards of DeFi. *Grow with us one day at a time.*

- [Yearn Security Processes](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/blob/master/SECURITY.md)

### They’re ERC20 compatible

Yearn Vaults are [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) compatible like any other commonly expected token. There is no code security overhead for developers to implement any yvToken as a new option for collateral.

### They’re almost 100% liquid

Strategies that lock tokens are kept to an absolute minimum amount of time. To learn more about strategies and funds allocation visit [yearn.watch](https://yearn.watch/) for a look into what’s going on.

### Split fees with Yearn
