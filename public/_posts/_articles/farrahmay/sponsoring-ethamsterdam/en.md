# Getting Started Building With Yearn

We recommend getting started by reviewing  [**our developer docs**](https://docs.yearn.finance/). They’ll show you everything from how to get your machine set up, how to get started building with vaults and strategies, and how to use the Yearn stack and the SDK to aggregate data sources. It is a lot easier than you think!
