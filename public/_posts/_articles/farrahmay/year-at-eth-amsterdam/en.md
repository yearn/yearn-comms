**DevConnect and ETHAmsterdam 2022 were a whirlwind of blockchain goodness and Yearn had a notable presence through the week. More than 20 Yearn contributors reunited at the conference and hackathon. We had a jam-packed week of talks, social gatherings, workshops, and meetings.**

**Here are some of the highlights our week in beautiful Amsterdam:)**

## Evolving Compensation and Governance at Yearn

DeFi Ginger took the stage at The DAOist‚Äôs Global Governance Gathering to discuss the topic of compensation and how Yearn‚Äôs thinking regarding compensation has evolved. Listen to this talk and others that day here.

## War Games!

The Yearn Finance x Tenderly War Room Simulation was the first security workshop of it‚Äôs kind! We had a packed house of developers participating in a high intensity capture the flag like game rife with surprises and curveballs to keep participants on their feet. From shitposters, blaring music, recitations of Euler‚Äôs equation and Taylor Swift, there was not shortage of FUD to keep participants on their feet.

## Secureum Trust X and MEV Day

Leading security builders, researchers, and OG‚Äôs spoke at the Secureum Trust X summit to discuss and debate security ideas, learn about and launch security products and services, and identify ways to partners and participate in the community.

Storm0x from Yearn joined other security gigabrains to deep dive into the topic of bug bounties and whitehats and their impacts on driving security best practices. **Storm0x‚Äôs talk starts at 8:55**!

MEV is a centralizing force across stateful blockchains. Understanding how we prevent blockchains from falling into the MEV dystopia is pivotal to safeguard from its negative impacts. Skeletor Spaceman from Yearn joined other thought leaders to discuss the MEV supply chain. **Skeletor‚Äôs panel starts at 4:00**!

## Meeting the Community
Previous night‚Äôs festivities notwithstanding, people were up early and bushy-tailed next morning for ‚ÄúBrunch with Yearn‚Äù. The brunch event provided attendees with dedicated space to relax, network, and work on their projects. Things really got into gear the next day when Yearn contributors meet for an intimate dinner. With the gorgeous exterior of an Amsterdam shipyard as backdrop, it was a great forum for team-building over delicious Dutch cuisine.
