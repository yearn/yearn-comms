Haven’t you heard, anon? DeFi is dead. Long live DeFi. Long live Yearn.

We’ve been preparing for a bear market, which is why we have a buffer of ~$20 million. But it’s not going to last forever, and that’s why we’re taking steps to make our warchest last as long as possible.

As contributors, we have identified inefficiencies that accumulated during the bull, and are now rethinking how we work and on what. We can do more with less.

Below we outline the action plan we’re executing against during the current market downturn in order to become more resilient.

Specifically, we focus our work to:

## Overhaul V2
Simpler and more automated strategies, reduce maintenance and overhead costs. Focus on Ethereum and its Layer 2s, and simplify the product offering. This will allow us to revise our fee structures and become more competitive.

## Prepare V3
Continue iterating, testing, and experimenting with the new V3 design, taking it to production, and ultimately have it replace V2.

## Grow B2B
Tools, documentation, tracking. Focus on automation and helping integrators onboard themselves. Offering a concierge-like experience for the largest depositors to retain their TVL.

## Release tokenomics
Finalize and launch veYFI and redistribute bought back YFI as added APYs to vaults to reclaim some of our lost TVL. Monitor performance and propose evolutions to YFI’s emission model as required.

## Stay on top of security.
Continue best-in-class security to provide the most attractive risk-adjusted yields in the market. Monitoring, peer reviews, audits, risk framework, testing, and simulations.

## Research new growth verticals
Small, contained research efforts to explore new sources of sustainable revenue and business models for yearn.


We’re doing this with less resources, taking a back-to-basics approach with a heavy focus on our core product and services, strategies, vault operations, engineering, and security. The plan is being actioned as part of our day to day operations. If you have thoughts, ideas, or questions get in touch with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yearn).

These are tough market times, but we’re seeing a lot of untapped opportunities and are confident we will come out stronger from this.

As always, we appreciate the support and belief in the team of yearn contributors.
