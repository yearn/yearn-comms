You may have noticed, [Yearn](http://yearn.finance) has a new look: [http://yearn.finance](http://yearn.finance)

The main site now acts as a hub for the Yearn ecosystem. Here you can find everything from Vaults to yBribe & yCRV. Yes, veYFI is here too (in governance mode only, stay calm anon).

Speaking of Vaults, the design is overhauled to make everything cleaner, easier to navigate, and with better information architecture. 

The new UI/UX is straightforward and even your grandmother (sorry if you are the grandmother) should be able to use it. In case you are always lost and need someone to show you how to do. Fasten your seatbelt, sit back and relax.
