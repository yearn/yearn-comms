###### Yearn Finance has issued a grant to [@atlantis0x](https://twitter.com/atlantis0x) to help build a 2d pixel metaverse. Here's why:

##### 1

[Atlantis World](https://twitter.com/atlantis0x) is a Web3 metaverse designed to expand access to virtual worlds, a 2d pixelverse that doesn't require expensive tech but will still melt faces.

They're building DAO and DeFi first, with education, community, governance, and security in mind from the start.

##### 3

We think the metaverse will play a big role in the future of DAOs and culture as we connect, gamify, and evolve the ecosystem.
