You’ve heard of ERC-20s, ERC-721s and ERC-1155s

Soon you shall know ERC-4626s

The Tokenized Vault Standard (ERC-4626) is final. And the Great Vault Standardization begins now

tl;dr 👇

Here’s the tldr on ERC-4626:

Yield-bearing tokens are a mess

Yield aggregators, vaults, lending markets and native yield tokens like [$xSUSHI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24xSUSHI&src=cashtag_click) are often implemented with slight variations

---

##### 3

To build a single app on top of DeFi's yield-bearing tokens, you have to write dozens of complex, error-prone adapters that can handle each unique variation

ERC-4626 makes that a thing of the past

---

##### 4

It’s composability at its finest

Build an app on top of one ERC-4626 vault, and it will work for all other ERC-4626 tokens

Yearn V3 + ERC-4626 = inevitable

Contributors are already working hard implementing the standard for Yearn’s V3 vaults

So are devs at [@AlchemixFi](https://twitter.com/AlchemixFi), [@balancer](https://twitter.com/balancer), [@RariCapital](https://twitter.com/RariCapital), [@feiprotocol](https://twitter.com/feiprotocol), [@OpenZeppelin](https://twitter.com/OpenZeppelin) and elsewhere

Perhaps one day, we’ll even see a Erc4626 tab on [@etherscan](https://twitter.com/etherscan)

In a word, ERC-4626 will be the gold standard for any sort of interest-bearing token… from Yearn Vaults to AAVE deposits and Balancer linear pools
