Bear market, bullish development.

While http://yearn.finance has recently added nice features like
@zapper_fi
integration for vaults, it still is in need of some love. For those following closely, you may have noticed hints about a new website in the works.

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù you might say, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt http://yearn.fi Yearn‚Äôs new website?‚Äù

Yes and no.

[@AndreCronjeTech](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech) is a mad scientist, and works at light speed while building out his prototypes. Consider http://yearn.fi his playground, built by himself and [@AntonNellCrypto](https://twitter.com/AntonNellCrypto). üß™

yearn.finance is maintained by a separate group of contributors, and we've been implementing a completely new backend (including an SDK with several APIs) that will power our new frontend, designed specifically with the SDK in mind.

##### 4

http://yearn.finance and http://yearn.fi have different approaches, but the hope is that they can be mutually beneficial to one another. Handshake

##### 5

yearn.fi is able to stand up new features very quickly, while the upcoming v3 http://yearn.finance will demonstrate the power of our reworked backend. Our goal? Abstracting away the complexity around integrating with yearn products for future partners.

Over the next few weeks, I'll go more in-depth on some of the tech we're building at yearn, why it matters, and what we're excited to work on next. And ultimately, we hope that this can make our work a little more accessible to everyone and a little less opaque. Left-pointing magnifying glass

Once the new site launches, this will include improving our GitHub issue curation for bugs, maintaining a bounty board for larger features we'd like to add, and in general reaching out a hand to anyone who'd like to contribute.

##### 8

If you'd like to come build with us, we'd love to have you. Simple as that.

Feel free to reach out to me on telegram
[@dudesahn](https://twitter.com/dudesahn) and we can get you started.
