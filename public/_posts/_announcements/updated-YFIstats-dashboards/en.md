[YFI Stats](https://www.yfistats.com/) has been updated with some new dashboards. We now have a YFI buybacks and a CRV from EPS airdrop dashboard to help users better visualize these metrics. These have been some of the most requested features recently and now they're live! If there are any other metrics you would like to see on YFI Stats feel free to reach out. You can check it out now at the links below.
